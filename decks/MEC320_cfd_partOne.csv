Describe Large Eddy Simulation (LES). What is its core idea and requirement?,"LES directly computes the large, energy-containing turbulent eddies by solving spatially filtered Navier-Stokes equations. The effects of the smaller, unresolved 'sub-grid scales' (SGS) on the resolved scales are modeled using an SGS model. Pros: More accurate than RANS for capturing unsteady turbulent structures. Cons: More computationally expensive than RANS; requires finer meshes; SGS modeling introduces approximations. Mesh must resolve large eddies.",2024-07-27,1.0,,CFD;Turbulence;LES;Modeling
Describe the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach. What does it solve for?,"RANS is based on decomposing instantaneous flow quantities into a time-averaged (mean) component and a fluctuating component (e.g., u = U + u'). The Navier-Stokes equations are then time-averaged. This process introduces new terms, the Reynolds stresses (e.g., -ρ<0xE2><0x9F><0xA8>u'ᵢu'ⱼ<0xE2><0x9F><0xA9>), which represent the effect of turbulence on the mean flow and must be modeled using empirical turbulence models (e.g., k-ε, k-ω). RANS solves only for the mean flow quantities. Pros: Computationally least expensive, widely used in engineering. Cons: All turbulence effects are modeled, accuracy depends heavily on the model choice, inherently steady-state or ensemble-averaged view.",2024-07-27,1.0,,CFD;Turbulence;RANS;Modeling;ReynoldsAveraging
Define the key variables and 'wall units' (inner variables) used for near-wall turbulent flow analysis.,"Key Variables: ν (kinematic viscosity), y (distance from wall), τ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA4> (wall shear stress). Wall Units (derived): u<0xE2><0x82><0x9C> (friction velocity = √(τ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA4>/ρ)), δ<0xE1><0xB5><0xA4> (viscous length scale = ν/u<0xE2><0x82><0x9C>). Dimensionless Wall Units: u⁺ = U/u<0xE2><0x82><0x9C> (dimensionless velocity), y⁺ = y u<0xE2><0x82><0x9C> / ν (dimensionless distance from the wall).",2024-07-27,1.0,Used to create universal profiles near the wall.,FluidDynamics;Turbulence;BoundaryLayer;WallUnits
"Why is DNS computationally expensive, especially at high Reynolds numbers? How do grid and time step requirements scale?","The range of turbulent scales increases dramatically with Re. To resolve the smallest (Kolmogorov) scales, the required number of grid points (N) scales roughly as Re⁹ᐟ⁴ or Re³. The required time step (Δt) must be small enough to resolve the fastest fluctuations, scaling roughly as Re⁻¹ᐟ² (based on friction velocity Re<0xE2><0x82><0x9C>). This leads to prohibitive computational cost for high Re flows.",2025-04-17,2.5,Re<0xE2><0x82><0x9C> is Reynolds number based on friction velocity.,CFD;Turbulence;DNS;Scaling;ComputationalCost
Mention some landmark DNS studies of turbulent channel flow and the trend in Reynolds numbers achieved.,"Early studies like Kim, Moin & Moser (1987) reached Re<0xE2><0x82><0x9C> ≈ 180. Later studies pushed this higher: Moser et al. (1999) to Re<0xE2><0x82><0x9C> ≈ 590; Sillero et al. (2013) to Re<0xE2><0x82><0x9C> ≈ 2000; Bernardini et al. (2014) to Re<0xE2><0x82><0x9C> ≈ 4000; Lee & Moser (2015) reached Re<0xE2><0x82><0x9C> ≈ 5200. The trend shows a slow but steady increase in achievable Re for DNS due to increasing computational power.",2024-07-27,1.0,,CFD;Turbulence;DNS;History;Research
