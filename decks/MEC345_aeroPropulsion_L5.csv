"How does afterburning increase thrust?","The higher temperature ($T_{06}$) entering the nozzle results in a much larger enthalpy drop across the nozzle (arrow 2 >> arrow 1 on T-s diagram), leading to a significantly higher exit jet velocity ($C_6 >> C_5$) and thus higher momentum thrust.","","","Slide 30","concepts,augmentation,afterburning,thrust_increase,velocity",2.5,0,0
"What is the purpose of components like 'Flameholders' in an afterburner system?","To create stable zones of recirculation where the flame can be anchored and maintained in the high-speed flow of the jet pipe.","","","Slide 31, 32","concepts,augmentation,afterburning,components,flameholder",2.5,0,0
"What negative effect does the additional equipment in the jet pipe for afterburning cause?","It causes additional pressure losses ($\Delta P_{afterburner}$) in the flow between the turbine exit and the nozzle inlet.","","","Slide 32","concepts,augmentation,afterburning,drawbacks,pressure_loss",2.5,0,0
"How can the pressure losses caused by afterburner equipment be mitigated?","By expanding the flow area in the jet pipe region (diffuser section) to slow down the air velocity before it encounters the equipment.","","","Slide 32","concepts,augmentation,afterburning,design,pressure_loss",2.5,0,0
"According to the example results, what typical performance changes occur when using afterburning?","Significant increase in thrust (e.g., +44%) accompanied by a very large increase in fuel consumption (e.g., +164%).","","","Slide 33","concepts,augmentation,afterburning,performance,thrust_increase,SFC",2.5,0,0
"Given its performance characteristics, when is afterburning typically used?","Only for short-term situations requiring maximum thrust, due to its high fuel consumption (e.g., take-off, supersonic acceleration, combat maneuvers).","","","Slide 33","concepts,augmentation,afterburning,usage",2.5,0,0
